## What this repo is for

This repo is a trial balloon for setting up a blog for a friend of mine to see how things work with github pages and jekyll.

## Based on

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Jekyll yet-another-theme](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/) built by [jeffreytse](https://jeffreytse.net) and [contributors](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/graphs/contributors).
Uses the Github Action named [jekyll-deploy-action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action) for Jekyll site deployment
